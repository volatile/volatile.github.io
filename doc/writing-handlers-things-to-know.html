<h1>Things to know</h1>
<ul>
	<li>
		When a handler writes the the response, it brakes the stream so a context <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/volatile/core#Context.Next" title="GoDoc"><code>Next</code></a> call has no effect.
	</li>
	<li>
		Headers must be set before the writing the response body. After that, trying to set a header has no effect.
	</li>
	<li>
		HTTP methods are case-sensitive (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.1">RFC 7231 4.1</a>).
	</li>
</ul>
